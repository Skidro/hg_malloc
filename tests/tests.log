In order to check malloc the following tests should be conducted:

1. Simple Test - Allocation and Deallocation
- Allocate 1024 bytes
- Deallocate 1024 bytes
- Sanity Check : Heap usage at the end of program should be zero
- Exp : Max memory usage should be 1024 bytes
- Exp : Largest allocation should be 1024 bytes

2. Multiple Allocations
- Allocate an array of 1024 pointers - 8KB
- For each allocated pointer, allocate 1024 bytes - 1024 x 1024 = 1MB
- Free up all the pointers one-by-one
- Free up the pointer array
- Sanity Check : Heap usage at the end of program should be zero
- Exp : Max memory usage should be 8KB + 1MB = 1024 x 1024 + 8 x 1024 = 1056768 bytes
- Exp : Largest allocation should be 8 Kbytes

3. Out of Memory - Restriction of the current version
- Allocate 950KB
- Allocate 950KB
- Allocate 512KB
- Santiy Check : Program will exit
- Exp : First two allocation should succeed
- Exp : Thrid allocation should fail with message : "Out of Memory!"

4. Reusage of Tracker
- Allocate 1024 bytes
- Allocate 512 bytes
- Allocate 1024 bytes
- Deallocate 512 bytes
- Allocate 512 bytes
- Deallocate all memory
- Sanity Check : Heap usage at the end of program should be zero
- Exp : The address returned for 4th allocation (i.e. 512 bytes) should be the same as
        the address returned for 2nd allocation
- Exp : Max heap usage should be 1024 + 1024 + 512 = 2560 bytes
- Exp : Largest allocation should be 1024 bytes

5. Fragmentation
- Allocate 1024 bytes
- Allocate 512 bytes
- Deallocate 1024 bytes
- Sanity Check : Heap size at the end of program should be 1024 + 512 + 2*40 (Trackers) = 1616 bytes
- Exp : Max heap usage should be 1024 + 512 = 1536 bytes
- Exp : Largest allocation should be 1024 bytes

6. Heap reduction
- Allocate 1024 bytes
- Allocation 512 bytes
- Allocate 1024 bytes
- Allocate 512 bytes
- Deallocate 1024 bytes (3rd allocation)
- Deallocate 512 bytes (4th allocation)
- Sanity Check : Heap usage at the end of program should be 1024 + 512 + 2*40 (Trackers) = 1616 bytes
- Exp : Max heap usage should be 1024 + 512 + 1024 + 512 = 3072 bytes
- Exp : Largest allocation should be 1024 bytes
